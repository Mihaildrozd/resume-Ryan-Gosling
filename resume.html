                <p>Gosling began his acting training at the John Bassett Theater Academy in Canada, from which he
                    graduated in 1993. He then attended Harvard University, where he received a degree in history in
                    1997.</p>

            <div class="card">
                <p>After Harvard, Gosling continued his studies at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (LAMDA)
                    and the American Academy of Dramatic Arts (AADA) in London and New York, respectively. He completed
                    his training at LAMDA in 2000 and at AADA in 2003.</p>

                <p>In addition to this, Gosling also took private lessons from an acting teacher at the Beverly Hills
                    Playhouse in Los Angeles. It is not an educational institution in the traditional sense, but rather
                    a place where actors can learn and improve under the guidance of experienced mentors.</p>

            <div>
                <p>As such, Gosling underwent rigorous training and training that made him one of the most talented
